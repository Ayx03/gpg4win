# Qt translations fails if any of those catalogs are missing; linuxdeploy automatically
# includes the catalogs of the modules we use, but as we do not use the other three
# we have to copy them ourselves

# /build/AppDir/usr/translations/kfoo5_qt.qm
# (note the missing language id in the symlinks) which obviously makes no sense;
