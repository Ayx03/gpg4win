* Add copyright statements to all files !!!

* Integrate patches into CVS !!!

* Record the dependencies in the build list in the gpg4win.mk.in
   Makefile using make dependencies between the stamp-final-$(1)
   targets.  This would hopefully ensure that parallel makes work. !

* Invent something clever to cope with new versions of packages, which
   may have a different file list.  We can't use globs because Delete
   must still work.  Either have inst-PACKAGE-VERSION.nsi files, or
   have globs plus some scripting to generate the .nis files. !

* Check out which locale files to install and where. !!!

* Check which iconv to use !!

* Strip the binaries (simple find running over the whole pkgs tree). !!

* Make make dist work. !!

* Finish modularization of installer.  NSIS' macro language is not up
   to the task, so we need a bit of configure/make magic as well (a la
   autoheader). !!!

* Allow to enable debug mode from configure line. !

* Finish integration of GnuPG.

* Add the missing packages: gpgee, Sylpheed, WinPT, Eudore extensions.

* gpgol needs to be registered. !!!
