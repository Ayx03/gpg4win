* No more ChangeLog files

  Do not modify any of the ChangeLog files in Gpg4win.  Starting on
  March 26, 2012 we put change information only in the GIT commit log,
  and generate a top-level ChangeLog file from logs at "make dist"
  time.  As such, there are strict requirements on the form of the
  commit log messages.  The old ChangeLog has been stored as
  build-aux/git-log-footer.

* Commit log requirements

  Your commit log should always start with a one-line summary, the
  second line should be blank, and the remaining lines are usually
  ChangeLog-style entries for all affected files.  However, it's fine
  -- even recommended -- to write a few lines of prose describing the
  change, when the summary and ChangeLog entries don't give enough of
  the big picture.  Omit the leading TABs that you're used to seeing
  in a "real" ChangeLog file, but keep the maximum line length at 72
  or smaller, so that the generated ChangeLog lines, each with its
  leading TAB, will not exceed 80 columns.  If you want to add text
  which shall not be copied to the ChangeLog, separate it by a line
  consisting of two dashes at the begin of a line.
