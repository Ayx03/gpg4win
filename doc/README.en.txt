1. Important notes
==================

At release date, the English version of the ebook `Gpg4win Compendium`
has not been updated for Gpg4win 3, but still is useful as documentation of
some general background how to use the product. You will find it
on your system (depending on the version of Windows) or online at

    https://www.gpg4win.org/doc/en/gpg4win-compendium.html

Note that the German version 4.0.0 is up-to-date and only available as pdf.

Please read the section `3. Additional notes` of this
README before you start working with Gpg4win.

The Compendium has more hints for manual or automated installation.


System requirements
-------------------

Gpg4win runs on Windows versions 7 or newer (up to Windows 10).
Both 32 and 64bit systems are supported. If you have at least Windows XP,
some parts of Gpg4win can be used, but are not officially supported.

The Outlook plugin GpgOL is compatible with Microsoft Outlook 2010,
2013 and 2016 (both 32 and 64bit) and supports transporting emails
via SMTP/IMAP and MS Exchange Server (version 2010 or newer).

With Gpg4win version 3.1.2 Outlook 2003 and 2007 support was removed for
security reasons.

(See https://www.gpg4win.org/system-requirements.html for updates.)

3. Additional notes
===================

- GpgOL

  * It is not possible to modify mails (e.g. moving / flagging the mail)
    while they are shown decrypted.
    To workaround this: unselect the crypto mail and then make changes
    through the right click context menu or move it with drag and drop.

  * Crypto mails forwarded as attachment are not properly handled.

  * The certificate selection dialog sometimes opens in the background and
    need an overhaul.

  * Localization is only there for German and Portuguese.

- General

  * For 3.2 we plan to, optionally, further automate GpgOL. This would
    set the GnuPG-Option:

        trust-model tofu+pgp

    As this is not properly handled everywhere (especially Kleopatra's
    file verification dialog) this is not default.

    You can add it manually to your gpg.conf. The trust-model is already
    supported by GpgOL.

- Kleopatra

  * Netkey cards are not yet supported by the new Manage Smartcard view.
