<h2>About gpg4win</h2>

The gpg4win project aims to provide and maintain a Windows-Installer
for
<a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> and
related products
(<a href="http://www.gnupg.org/(en)/related_software/gpa/index.html">GPA</a>,

as well as documentation).

<p>
It is an international project. Apart from the english as default,
currently german language is fully supported, maintainers for other languages are welcome.

<p>
The main difference compared to similar projects
(<a href="http://www.gnupp.de/start.html">GnuPP</a> and
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/winpt">Windows Privacy Tools</a>) is
that at first we developed the <b>gpg4win-Builder</b>.
This one allows to very easily create new gpg4win.exe installers
with updated components.
This could even be done on a GNU/Linux system where almost
all products are automatically cross-compiled.

<p>
With this approach we hope to avoid quick aginf of installer packages
as it happened in the past with the other approaches, because it is quite
simple to create updates.
