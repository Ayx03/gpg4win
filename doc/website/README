                           gpg4win Web Site
----------------------------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION:

The .html files are build from the *.htm4 files using GNU m4.  The
*.htm4 files consist of mainly simple plain HTML and some macros
implementing the overall page layout.

The structure of the .htm4 files should be rather self explaining.


BUILDING:

Building the web site is _not_ incorporated into the autotools based
build process.

To build to web sites use the file `buildhtml.mk':

  make -f buildhtml.mk


INSTALLING:

To install the generated web site you need a gpg4win docwriter or
developer account on wald.intevation.org.

Installing is done from within the "doc/website" directory, using
rsync:

rsync -urvP *.css *.html pix/*.png USER@wald.intevation.org:/gpg4win/htdocs/

Where USER is your accounts user name on wald.intevation.org.

For further information on web site management on wald.intevation.org
please read the online manual:

TEMPLATES:

versions.m4 : Definitions of some macros, holding the current versions
              of gpg4win and the included software packages.  If any
              version changes this file should be changed accordingly.
              This file is included by `template_header.m4'.
              The current version numbers of the packages installed by 
              gpg4win can be found here:
              ftp://ftp.gpg4win.org/gpg4win/packages.current

template.m4 : Contains the definition of the main macros PAGE_START
              and PAGE_BOXES as well as some helper macros normally
              not used in the .htm4 files.  Authors should not need to
              change this file.

template_header.m4: Contains the actual page layout.  This file is
                    included by `template.m4'.  Authors should not
                    need to change this file, but if additional
                    languages are added the navigation must be added
                    in here.
