<h2>About Gpg4win</h2>

The Gpg4win <b>project aims at</b> updating the Gpg4win Windows installation
package with GnuPG encryption tool, associated applications and
documentation on a regular basis.
Especially the documentation (handbooks "Novices"
and "Durchblicker") are directly maintained as part of the Gpg4win project.

<p>
It is an international project. Due to the origin of the project and
many members, German language is fully supported as well.
Currently the handbooks are even only available in German.
Any translators are very welcome!
</p>
<p>
The main difference compared to all other similar approaches
(mainly GnuPP, GnuPT, Windows Privacy Tools and GnuPG-Basics)
is that the first thing developed was the <b>Gpg4win-Builder</b>.
This builder allows to easily create new gpg4win.exe installers
with updated components.
It runs best on a GNU/Linux system. Almost all products
are even automatically cross-compiled for integration into
the installer.
</p>
<p>
With this concept it is hoped to good practical support to <b>prevent
quick aging of the installer package</b>. Because updating is much easier
and does not depend on a single person.
