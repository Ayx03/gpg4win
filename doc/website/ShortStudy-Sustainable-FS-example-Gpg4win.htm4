Anyone investing in the development of Free Software (Open Source)
usually wants to achieve a long-lasting effect despite a limited
budget. In addition, the promotion of open and independent further
development is also an objective.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
Using the encryption solution &quot;Gpg4win&quot;, measures that can
achieve this goal will be discussed. Starting point of the study is
the analysis of to-date initiatives that are comparable to the
Windows version of GnuPG software.</P>

A motivation and qualification process should be established for
allocating and placing the necessary competencies. The promotion of
commercial stakeholders is an ideal complement to this process. The
long-term objective is the financing of a professional management for
a portion of the required activities. The path leading to this
objective must be made possible and also well communicated.</P>

How this could work for Gpg4win will be shown below. The technical
progress achieved with Gpg4win's forms a basis for these measures. A
slow withdrawal from an investment would be ideal, so that at each
time other participants could take over.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western">2  Introduction</H2>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%; page-break-inside: auto; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
This short study was put together parallel to the product &quot;Gpg4win&quot;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A>.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%; page-break-inside: auto; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
Gpg4win is an installation package for Microsoft Windows which
contains numerous help programs and extensive German documentation
besides the actual encryption application &quot;GnuPG&quot;. The
objective of this project is to improve the usability of the
encryption software GnuPG and to therefore facilitate the use and
operation of cryptography for laymen computer users. For this
purpose, in addition to the simple installation of the software, the
integration of the command line tool GnuPG into graphics user
interfaces such as &quot;Outlook 2003&quot; and &quot;Sylpheed Claws&quot;
is also promoted.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%; page-break-inside: auto; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
In this way Gpg4win intends to replace the outdated GnuPP<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A>,
which has not been updated for a while. It is hoped that such a
standstill situation can be avoided for Gpg4win. The objective of
this short study is to discuss the corresponding measures.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%; page-break-inside: auto; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
Version 1.0 of Gpg4win has updated the software. This short study
suggests a strategy of how a self-sustaining project can develop. The
goal is to facilitate a more sustained further development of
Gpg4win.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%; page-break-inside: auto; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
Starting point for the short study are the general success factors
for Free Software projects, as well as the problems regarding an
sustainable further development of GnuPP, Windows Privacy Tools <A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote3anc" HREF="#sdfootnote3sym"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
and comparable approaches.</P>

While this study is concerned with Gpg4win, more general conclusions
may also be drawn, especially for products which are the result of a
bigger project and are targeted towards Microsoft Windows as the
basic operating system.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%; page-break-inside: auto; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
In the end, this study intends to highlight the issues. even though
there are a number of additional aspects that are also worthy of
examination but could not be mentioned or discussed. As a result this
short study is meant as a starting point and motivating factor for
thinking about the kind of questions which need to be asked regarding
the sustained existence of Free Software products.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">3  Methodology</H2>

A search of the literature regarding the main content areas &quot;Free
Software in Windows&quot;, &quot;Security Software&quot; or
&quot;Structure and sustainability as a result of a commercial
development project&quot; did not yield any helpful results, whether
in English or German. The literature is mainly limited to
technological success factors for Free Software initiatives and the
development of individual business models on the basis of Free
Software products.</P>

Also included in this study are the many years of experience by the
authors with Free Software, a topic with which they have dealt with
exclusively and professionally since 1999. The authors have carried
out a number of different projects for e-mail encryption with GnuPG
since 2000.</P>

What is a &quot;Free Software Project&quot;?</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%; page-break-inside: auto; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
Free Software is software which is accompanied with a permanent
authorisation that it can be used by anyone for any purpose. The
distribution, improvement and copying of improvements of the software
is also allowed. Here Free Software is used analogous to the term
used by the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE). Other terms for
Free Software are &quot;Open Source&quot; or &quot;Libre Software&quot;.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%; page-break-inside: auto; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
In its original connotation, a project is a one-time undertaking.
This meaning has changed somewhat for Free Software, as it no longer
signifies just a one-time undertaking, but usually a sustained
activity around a software, whereby the latter is created and further
developed and maintained for an indefinite period of time. Besides
the actual software, documentation, infrastructure, availability of
information and participants also form a part of this activity.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%; page-break-inside: auto; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
For each software project a number of different tasks must be carried
out on a regular basis. The activity is said to function when these
tasks are assumed by those who are directly involved. According to
literature, participants in a Free Software project can be divided
into four large groups:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%">

	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%">

As a result, the following applies to each functioning Free Software
project:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.32cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Which tasks must be assumed on a regular basis?</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.32cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
	Who carries out these tasks?</P>

Someone interested in Free Software can participate in two ways:
contributing time/labour or money. The amount can be freely chosen.
At the same time, tasks can only be carried out with labour, while
contributed funds must be converted into labour. This brings up the
question regarding qualification and business model.</P>


<H2 CLASS="western">4.1  Participant structure</H2>
<P>A successful Free Software project is
characterised by a balanced cooperation of participants, as shown in
Figure 1. As a rule, adjacent layers communicate actively with each
other, for example, contributors with power users and developers.</P>

The individual in the circle of core developers who has the final
word on decisions regarding architecture, the inclusion of new
functions or similar items. This is not usually a position involving
authoritative characteristics, but rather concerns the tasks of
moderating discussions regarding architecture and functionalities.
Issues regarding the rights, duties, election and replacement of the
coordinator are handled differently in many Free Software projects.
In the very rare event of a dissent that cannot be resolved, the Free
Software project is split into two projects.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%; page-break-inside: auto; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
The qualification and integration processes are very important for
Free Software activities. If a project is able to turn users into
power users, and power users into contributors etc., the result is an
additional motivation as well as support for the original core
developers. They are then able to push forward the product per se and
thus concentrate on work that directly benefits users.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%; page-break-inside: auto; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
Because of the type of structures that developed it is very difficult
to directly recruit a core developer or developer. An individual must
grow into this leadership position. For this reason, a large number
of users is an important factor as it forms the basis for the
integration. There are conventional ways of increasing the number of
users and popularise the respective Free Software activities - in the
case of Free Software, attaining new users is achieved mainly through
globalisation, entry into different software indices and through
personal contact on mailing lists and meetings.</P>

The transition from the first management group to the second is a
critical item for each Free Software activity. Many times it is a
very specific person who started and instilled life into the project.
At some point this person loses interest in the software or is no
longer able to continue working on it and must transfer
responsibility for the project. At this point it becomes very evident
whether there is enough critical mass to form a new management group.
A positive aspect is if the work was already previously divided among
several individuals. Hence, the broader the pyramid in Figure 1, the
better.</P>

of successful projects</H2>

The following two examples describe successful Free Software
projects, the reasons for their success and how they differ from
Gpg4win.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">4.2.1  Apache</H2>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%; page-break-inside: auto; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
With over 60% market share<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote6anc" HREF="#sdfootnote6sym"><SUP>6</SUP></A>,
the web server &quot;Apache&quot; has been a worldwide leading
product for years. Apache was Free Software from the beginning and
was further developed and improved by responsible system
administrators one step at a time. Almost all work done on Apache was
the result of concrete technical and in part urgently required
requirements. These requirements originated mainly from a series of
businesses which use the web server intensively.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%; page-break-inside: auto; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
The large number of users and developers led to the creation of the
Apache Software Foundation<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote7anc" HREF="#sdfootnote7sym"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
(ASF). It now supports and coordinates over 30 individual projects in
the area of web-based services. In total there are over 1,000 active
developers registered with ASF.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%; page-break-inside: auto; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
Certainly, decisive success factors include the existence of actual
technical requirements and the fact that the users, hence also the
administrators, are highly qualified on a technical level. Many users
are capable of carrying out their own analysis and fixing of errors.
Furthermore users and developers are able to use Apache on the
software/hardware system they are familiar with, which is an
additional motivating factor.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%; page-break-inside: auto; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
In contract, Gpg4win users usually have less technical
qualifications. Obviously, one reason for this is that Gpg4win is a
program for end users rather than a server application which is
geared towards administrators.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%; page-break-inside: auto; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
Furthermore, Gpg4win automatically specifies the operating system.
Gpg4win does not present a real challenge to programmers, since as a
meta project it is not directed towards actual programming. Results
obtained from other projects (e.g. GnuPG) are also taken in.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">4.2.2  Samba</H2>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%; page-break-inside: auto; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
Samba is a Free Software implementation of data and print services
for SMB/CIFS clients. SMB and CIFS are proprietary protocols of
Microsoft. A Samba installation can seamlessly replace both a
respective Windows client or Windows server for data and printing
services, i.e. without the other systems in the network knowing or
even being aware of its presence. At the same time it represents a
bridge to data and printing services under GNU/Linux.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%; page-break-inside: auto; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
In many companies Samba has replaced data servers by Microsoft or
Novell. It is used anywhere where mixed environments consisting of
GNU/Linux and Windows work places exist, and in part even in pure
Windows environments.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
The decisive success factor for Samba is the very real interest of
many companies in utilising this solution. In addition, in its role
as data server it also presents a critical application for almost all
companies. which also means that budgets for this purpose will exist,
which explains why there are now a number of companies which offer
services for Samba. Some of these companies will also have employees
who focus on the improvement and further development of Samba.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%; page-break-inside: auto; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
In contrast to the Apache project there are significantly fewer
administrators who are technically qualified to independently carry
out improvements to Samba.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%; page-break-inside: auto; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
In contrast to a data server, the encryption of e-mails is not
considered a critical application for most companies. For this reason
there are smaller budgets for maintenance and support contracts. In
the case of Gpg4win it is more difficult for a commercial market to
develop as easily and quickly as for Samba, because the latter was
more suited for commercialisation due to its key significance for
companies.</P>

The project was finished successfully in 2000 and was subsequently
presented at exhibitions. Also developed as part of the project were
the graphics key manager Gnu Privacy Assistant (GPA), a revised
GnuPG, the German web pages www.gnupg.de, the Gnu Privacy handbook in
German and English, the crypto-programming library GpgME, several
feasibility analyses on the integration into different e-mail
programs, and integration into the e-mail program Sylpheed. Other
items worthy of mention include the development of WinPT (support for
the operation of the Windows clipboard for encryption purposes) and
the Gdata Outlook plug-in for the use of GnuPG in the e-mail program
Outlook. Both products were independently contributed by third
parties and are therefore to be considered as a collateral benefit.

were also published in brochure form at considerable print volumes

project home page under www.gnupp.de was also created (although
significantly reduced since that time), as were a user forum in the

It is thought that the lack of additional financial support caused
G-N-U GmbH to stop offering active support at the end of 2002,

There were increasing incidents of problem reports on the mailing
lists, and while they were partially corrected in the components
themselves (e.g. GnuPG by the GnuPG developer team), no updated
installation packets were made available.</P>

Neither the source code for the installer nor instructions for the
assembly of an installer were provided on a general basis. However,
it stands to reason that the sources were made available on explicit
requests. Still, it must be mentioned that in the end an update of
GnuPP by third parties never took place.</P>

Within the context of GnuPP there are no visible activities that are
designed to interest and enable those with technical knowledge in
order to entrust them with the updating of the installer or web page.
It must be concluded then that this was not a declared objective of
the project.</P>

Objectives and requirements corresponded roughly with the GnuPP

Despite its short activity phase, the project appears to be very
popular. Download volumes are quite impressive and are probably above
those for GnuPP: P-WinPT 1.0rc2: more than 270,000, P-WinPT Handbook

The fact that the links list did not make reference to either GnuPP
or any other similar approaches can also be considered a weakness. It
is only when one is aware of alternatives that comparisons can be

be a result of this being the only visible avenue for users to
address problems associated with P-WinPT.</P>

The P-WinPT project finally attempted to integrate the software WinPT
into itself. No links are found on the WinPT home page, where new
versions were announced until August 2004 and downloads were also
provided. Without carrying out additional research a user would not
know that the software WinPT is an independent project which in the
meantime has been extensively improved. As a result, this attempt can
be seen as a tactical error.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%">

One difficulty for the qualification process from user to power user
etc. certainly is the fact that it concerns the Microsoft Windows
platform. As a result, compared to GNU/Linux there are typically less
qualified users or fewer users who want to be qualified. The active
participation in a project is a process that users of Free Software
are very familiar with. GNU/Linux consists of Free Software. One
could also say that GNU/Linux was predisposed to include users in the
further development through motivation and qualification 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%; page-break-inside: auto; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
Added to that is that software development for Microsoft Windows is
technically more demanding since most components are proprietary,
unlike Free Software where they can be easily analysed and corrected
where required. Within the framework of Gpg4win, GPGol (Outlook
plug-in) is a good example for this situation &ndash; because of
insufficient documentation and programming errors in Outlook a large
part of time for labour was expended into so-called reverse
engineering and the preparation of so-called workarounds, instead of
designing functionality. Another difference is the availability of
development tools - developers under Windows often have a proprietary
tool kit which is also an obstacle if another developer wants to
continue work at a certain spot. In the meantime, the resulting
problem has moved Microsoft to remove some of the development tools
from commercial distribution. However, despite their free
availability the tools remain proprietary and are thus not available
in the source code, among others.</P>

Since Gpg4win is security software, which in part requires knowledge
of fairly sophisticated concepts, the circle of potential
contributors is therefore limited. Alone the writing of good
documentation material usually requires in-depth security knowledge.
Also, in order to ensure consistent trust in the software, a
corresponding quality management process is meaningful. This is not
usually a fun task for most volunteers.</P>

Finally, one difference between GNU/Linux and Windows is that
GNU/Linux distributions (Debian, SUSE, Fedora, etc.) integrate useful
and good-quality products as fixed components. This is not the case
for Windows, where products must be separately installed. Hence,
while practically every GNU/Linux system comes pre-installed with
GnuPG, software such as Gpg4win must be separately installed on each
Windows computer.</P>

Gpg4win is a meta project. In this way it is different from many
other projects which are each dedicated to a specific software
implementation.</P>

Gpg4win integrated different products from other projects. The main
result is an installation packet for Windows operating systems which
is made available as a download. Besides the automated routine for
the creation of installation packets, the handbooks &quot;Gpg4win for
Novices&quot; and &quot;Gpg4win for Experts&quot; are also considered
'real', proper parts of the project.</P>

This requires certain technical knowledge. Training can be further
facilitated with a good tutorial, which should consist of examples
which illustrate what has been done to update one or other
components. It should also take into account some 'extreme cases',
e.g. modification of paths and environmental variables.</P>

Often it is the commercial interest in a Free Software that is the
key to sustained further development. However, short-term economic
individual interests should not become the main influencing factor,
as this type of commercialisation would be damaging. Above all, the
four freedoms, more precisely the licensing as Free Software, must be
preserved. This still leaves room for profit and occupation - in
fact, both of these are desirable. A level of professionalism has
advantages, especially for the required tedious tasks and consistent
quality.</P>

The objective of commercial stakeholders is a more sustained linking
of main developers to the project, as developers may be able to earn
a part of their income by undertaking activities for the project.
They are not subject to other obligations which could potentially
interrupt or end participation fairly quickly. This point is
particularly important in the case of Gpg4win, since the described
difficulties (compare section 7.1) likely lead to a smaller number of

It is recommended that a commercial stakeholder model is pursued for
Gpg4win. There are different forms of support services which
represent a meaningful business model. Anyone working with Gpg4win
who is in part dependent on the flawless functioning of the software,
has a strong interest in maintaining the continuity and quality of
the software, as well as in having available contact persons with
in-depth technical knowledge and quick response times. At the same
time, a self-sustaining business is only created in steps.

Gpg4win already possesses a considerable number of users and has
therefore achieved a certain level of visibility. This creates the
basis for contacting sponsors/stakeholders from within the user
community. Where required, these sponsors may also be requested to
provide band width, financing or attend exhibitions or meetings.</P>

It is also important to establish the value of the software for the
users on a more general level, because it has a direct relationship
to the willingness to pay. Many Free Software projects already enable
small payments, called 'donations'. This presents a large long-term
potential<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote13anc" HREF="#sdfootnote13sym"><SUP>13</SUP></A>.
A dialogue with sponsors and the number of donations provides
valuable clues as to what has been solved particularly well in
Gpg4win or where this is still room for improvement. The suggestions
are valuable because there is a difference between the comment &quot;I
would like to see function X in Gpg4win expanded&quot; and a donation
of 100 Euro with the comment &quot;I found function Y very helpful,
it would be nice if it could be expanded&quot;. The first could be a
quick off-the-cuff comment, whereas the latter is generally well
thought out.</P>

What to do with the money? Smaller amounts, hence amounts under EUR
10,000 annually, should be used to bring in additional individuals.
This means qualifying and motivating existing users or power users
(public relations work and marketing, compare section 7.6). A direct,
commissioned payment for development services will likely only be
meaningful with larger amounts. In this case, measures for
safeguarding a sustained further development should have priority.
Furthermore the commissioning of further development of the basis
components are also considered significant, as Gpg4win continues to
be a meta project and to a certain extent represents the interface
between Windows users and the actual software projects, hence the
dissemination of information to users is not only fair on principle
alone. It is also meaningful for the success of Gpg4win, because this
meta project also benefits from the explicit goodwill of developers
of the software module which forms its basis.</P>

Next steps may include the establishment of business models by the

The safeguarding of the basic continuity may be provided by just one
company which expresses sufficient interest, whether for utility or
marketing value. Of course continuity would also be at risk in the
case of withdrawal by this one supporter. Hence a further objective
should be to find more than one supporter, and to ensure that these
supporters are not dependent on the same source (e.g. a certain
customer).</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
The ideal scenario is the financing by one sponsor, which would
secure the implementation of all three items. The main objective here
is the simultaneous step-by-step withdrawal from financial
sponsorship as soon as the intended structures are able to support
themselves and are beginning to grow in a sustained manner.</P>

In order to increase the motivation of users, developers and
sponsors, we recommend an incentive concept, such as special pins as
proof/recognition of helpful assistance (compare Section 7.6). This
concept requires a decision-making process for the awarding
procedures as well as an individual who will send out the pins.</P>

Also helpful are meetings which allow power users and developers to

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; background: transparent; border: none; padding: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
The qualification process requires the existence of already qualified

Another recommendation for Gpg4win is to set up an opportunity to
make monetary donations using the home page, and to find an
organisational method for the acceptance and distribution of the
funds (see Section 7.5).</P>
