No more ChangeLog files
========================

Do not modify any of the ChangeLog files in Gpg4win.  Starting on
March 26, 2012 we put change information only in the GIT commit
log, and generate a top-level ChangeLog file from logs at "make dist"
time.  As such, there are strict requirements on the form of the
commit log messages.  See doc/HACKING for details.  The old ChangeLog
has been stored as build-aux/git-log-footer.
