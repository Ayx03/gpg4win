This is gpg4win - the GUI Installer Builder for W32.

Instructions:
=============

1. Download the source and binary packages that are required to build
   the installer:

   $ cd packages
   $ sh download.sh
   [...]
   $ cd ..

2. Configure the source tree for cross compilation:

   $ configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc

3. Build the installer:

   $ make

The installer will be made available in two files:

src/gpg4win-X.Y.Z.exe
src/gpg4win-src-X.Y.Z.exe


Adding new packages to the installer:
=====================================

This requires editing a couple of files; we might eventually automate
some of tehse tasks.  Here is a short run up:

1. Add constants for the package FOO into include/config.nsi.in .

2. Create 2 new installer scripts, named src/inst-foo.nsi and
   uninst-foo.nsi .

3. Add foo to one the variables gpg4win_bpgks (if foo should not be
   build be the gpg4win) or gpg4win_spkgs (if foo should be build by
   gpg4win) in src/Makefile.am

4. Add FOO to inst-sections.nsi.

5. Add detection of packages to configure.ac.  Check out the available
   macros in m4/gpg4win.m4.  Depending on the way an upstream package
   is packaged, you might need to write a new macro.

6. Add download information to packages/download.sh.

Then run the usual "./autogen.sh" to create the actual configure file
and run configure as described above.
