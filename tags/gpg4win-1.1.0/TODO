* next release

  We need tocheck whether setting Threadpriority in 01-giowin32.pacth
  is still required.  It is not in upstream.

  02-gspawn-w32.patch is required.
  03-gspawn-w32-fixup.patch is required.

  (04-* is not required).


* Build system
** Some versions of strip don't work.
   Werner's GNU strip 2.15.91 20040904 is fine but
   Marcus'  GNU strip 2.15.94 20050118 does not work.
** Mo file installation macro

* Component related issues:
** Check which iconv to use !!
** Finish integration of GnuPG.
** Add the missing packages: Sylpheed Eudore extensions.
** Remove the /nonfatal from the keyserver helper installing
     This might need that we check what files are actually available.

* The following items are related to package auto-detection and
   configuration.  They are not critical.
** BUG: If there is more than one version of a package, the script
   breaks.  The GPG4WIN_FIND function must filter and pick one of the
   matches.
** GLITCH: If unnecessary dependency packages are enabled, they are
   included in the installer, although they never will be (and can't
   be) installed (they can't be installed because they can't be
   selected).  To fix this, configure would need to know which
   packages can be selected and which can't.
** Invent something clever to cope with new versions of packages, which
   may have a different file list.  We can't use globs because Delete
   must still work.  Either have inst-PACKAGE-VERSION.nsi files, or
   have globs plus some scripting to generate the .nis files. !
** Record the dependencies in the build list in the gpg4win.mk.in
   Makefile using make dependencies between the stamp-final-$(1)
   targets.  This would hopefully ensure that parallel makes work. !
