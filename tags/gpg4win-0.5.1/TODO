* Missing stuff
** Create a text file to record the version numbers
   of all installed packages and distribute it with the .exe.  If
   possible HTML formatted with links to the NEWS files of the
   packages.
** Add gpg translations to the installer

* Build system
** Some versions of strip don't work.
   Werner's GNU strip 2.15.91 20040904 is fine but
   Marcus'  GNU strip 2.15.94 20050118 does not work.
** Mo file installation macro


* Component related issues:
** Check out which locale files to install and where. !!!
** Check which iconv to use !!
** Finish integration of GnuPG.
** Add the missing packages: Sylpheed Eudore extensions.

* The following items are related to package auto-detection and
   configuration.  They are not critical.
** BUG: If there is more than one version of a package, the script
   breaks.  The GPG4WIN_FIND function must filter and pick one of the
   matches.
** GLITCH: If unnecessary dependency packages are enabled, they are
   included in the installer, although they never will be (and can't
   be) installed (they can't be installed because they can't be
   selected).  To fix this, configure would need to know which
   packages can be selected and which can't.
** Invent something clever to cope with new versions of packages, which
   may have a different file list.  We can't use globs because Delete
   must still work.  Either have inst-PACKAGE-VERSION.nsi files, or
   have globs plus some scripting to generate the .nis files. !
** Record the dependencies in the build list in the gpg4win.mk.in
   Makefile using make dependencies between the stamp-final-$(1)
   targets.  This would hopefully ensure that parallel makes work. !
** Version number for the created installers
  We may want to have a different version number for the actual
  installers.  It does not make sense to update the gpg4win version
  number with each release and there will probably difdferent
  installers released based on the same gpg4win packaes.  Thus a
  configure option to set a "vendor" name as wenn as build number is
  appreciated.  Not sure how this can make it into the file version of
  the actual .exe files as we are using the Revision number of SVN
  there. and we don't have enough space to encode a nedor tag and
  vendor version.  May be this should go into the version info's text
  strings.
