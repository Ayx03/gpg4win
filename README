This is gpg4win - the GUI Installer Builder for W32.

See also the file doc/README.en.txt.

Instructions:
=============

1. Download the source and binary packages that are required to build
   the installer:

   $ cd packages
   $ sh download.sh
   [...]
   $ cd ..

2. Configure the source tree for cross compilation:

   $ ./autogen.sh --build-w32

3. Build the installer:

   $ make

The installer will be made available in three files:

src/gpg4win-X.Y.Z.exe
src/gpg4win-light-X.Y.Z.exe
src/gpg4win-src-X.Y.Z.exe


Basic requirements
==================

A decent POSIX system is required for building this software as well
as GNU make.  We are using Debian GNU/Linux (Lenny); due to a little
bug in the mingw32 compiler it is highly suggested to put a line
  deb http://apt.intevation.org lenny/mingw .
into /etc/apt/sources and update the mingw packages.  To satisfy all
needs of configure at least the following packages need to be
installed:

 build-essential (libc6-dev, gcc, g++, make)
 automake, autoconf (if building from SVN)
 mingw32
 nsis
 stow
 unzip
 texinfo
 imagemagick
 tetex-bin
 tetex-extra
 latex-xcolor (for the compendium)
 tr
 gs-common
 hyperlatex
 sharutils (uudecode for claws icon patch)
 gettext (msgfmt, dcgettext, gmsgfmt, xgettext for glib)
 libglib2.0-dev (glib-genmarshal for glib)


Building the Webpages
=====================

This has not been automated.  See the README file in the doc/website
directory.  To build the HTML version of the manuals you need to go to
doc/manual-de, run the command "make webversion" and copy the require
files to the desired location.  If you are a developer with write
access to the Sibversion, you may use the "online" target to actually
update the website.

Development Branches
====================

The old version of gpg4win (version < 1.2) is since 1.1.3 tracked by
the SVN branch: branches/gpg4win-1-branch.  Only important fixes will
go into this version.  The current version is in the SVN trunk starts
as version 1.9 and will soon lead to version 2.0.



Adding new packages to the installer:
=====================================

This requires editing a couple of files; we might eventually automate
some of these tasks.  Here is a short run up:

1. Add constants for the package FOO into include/config.nsi.in .

2. Create 2 new installer scripts, named src/inst-foo.nsi and
   uninst-foo.nsi and add them to EXTRA_DIST in src/Makefile.am.

3. Add foo to one the variables gpg4win_bpgks (if foo should not be
   build be the gpg4win) or gpg4win_spkgs (if foo should be build by
   gpg4win) in src/Makefile.am .  Also add any required configure
   flags etc.

4. Add FOO to inst-sections.nsi.

5. Add detection of packages to configure.ac.  Check out the available
   macros in m4/gpg4win.m4.  Depending on the way an upstream package
   is packaged, you might need to write a new macro.

6. Add download information to packages/download.sh.

7. If the package ships pkg-config (*.pc) support files, you need add
   post install instructions to Makefile.am.  Note that *.pc files may
   be in the "runtime" directory ${pkgidir} if the package is built
   within gpg4win (or peculiarly shipped), or in the development
   package ${pkgidir_dev}.

Then run the usual "./autogen.sh" to create the actual configure file
and run configure as described above.


Version numbers
===============

We use a specific order of version numbers.  This is best shown by an
example:

  1.0.0             - The final 1.0.0 release. 
  1.0.1-svn1234     - A snapshot based on SVN revision 1234
  1.0.1-svn1235     - A newer snapshot
  1.0.1rc1-svn1236  - A snapshot while preparing for a release candidate
  1.0.1rc1          - The first release candidate for 1.0.1
  1.0.1-svn1240     - yet another snapshot
  1.0.1             - The final 1.0.1 release

The important point is that we bump up the version number before we do
an release and append a suffix to mark it as a development version.
This allows other software to use a configure check for the next to be
released version of gpg4win.
