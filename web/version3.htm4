<h2>Version 3</h2>
<p>Gpg4win (GNU Privacy Guard for Windows) is now stable in Version 3.</p>

<h2>What's new?</h2>
<h3>GnuPG</h3>
<p>Support of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) by integration
of the upcoming GnuPG 2.2 release candidate.

There are a lot more general improvements coming with GnuPG 2.2,
for a long technical list, see
<a href=https://www.gnupg.org/faq/whats-new-in-2.1.html">

<p>Preparing for better overall crypto user experience: Fetching pubkeys
by default.</p>

<p>Most users want some basic level of confidentiality for their email
and file exchanges without having to deal with crypto details
like distributing and checking pubkeys and their signatures.
An update to Gpg4win 3.0 will provide an implementation of a
concept called 'web key directory/service'.
It will by default try to fetch missing pubkeys and find them for a
given email address. This behavior can be switched off, of course.
For details see</p>

  <li>'--auto-key-retrieve' and '--auto-key-locate' in the GnuPG documentation.</li>

<h3>Major Outlook-Support improvement for attachments and encodings</h3>
<p>
The included Outlook Plugin (GpgOL) has been completely overhauled.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Complete support for OpenPGP/MIME in MS Outlook
    2007/2010/2013/2016 (32 and 64bit). This allows to send
    and receive text in other languages and attachments in a proper
    way.</li>
    <li>New user interface to display the state of encryption directly
    in the mail window.</li>
    <li>Support for sending and receiving HTML Emails.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Kleopatra (Crypto-Manager)</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The file-encryption dialogues have been redesigned to
    reduce the clicks and enhance the user experience.</li>
    <li>Kleopatra recognizes automatically the kind of a crypto-file
    and executes the according action on a double-click (e.g.
    decrypting an encrypted file).</li>
    <li>New smart-card management view.</li>
    <li>New first start dialogue (when key management is empty).</li>
    <li>Detail-view on key-details has been improved.</li>
    <li>Support for automatic import of missing pubkeys has been
    implemented (WKD).</li>
    <li>Many UI- and stability improvements and additional translations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>And more</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Added and enabled by default: a check over the internet
    for available updates, which will notify the user.</li>
    <li>A more straight forward installation process.</li>
    <li>Installation as normal user (without administration priviledges)
    now possible.</li>
    <li>Gpg4win compendium (German version) has been completely overhauled.
    We are looking for people to help us translating the changes back
    into English and other languages.</li>
</ul>
