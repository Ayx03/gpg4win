# The patches for glib are problematic because they require that
# autotools and libtoolize must be run.  The problem way is to also
# patch configure but that needs too many changes.  Because we plan to
# remove glib (and GPA) anyway, we just call autoreconf which should
# not be worse than what we have right now; i.e. requiring the exact
# automake version 1.15 to be installed.
